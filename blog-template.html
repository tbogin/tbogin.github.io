<!-- How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
	Pairing to make a wireframe and HTML page allowed us to bounce ideas off one another, troubleshoot, and agree on best practices.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
	Wireframing is very helpful for me, as I like to visualize page layout before writing my code.

What did you and your pair decide makes a good wireframe?
	We decided the best wireframe is simple and basic. Any details, of which there would be few, could be decided upon later.

What new semantic elements did you learn about?
	We used a few semantic elements we learned earlier in the week.
