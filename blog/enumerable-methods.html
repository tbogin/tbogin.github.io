<h1>Dev Bootcamp Week 5</h1>
<h2>Enumerable Methods: Inject</h2>
<h4>March 11th, 2016</h4>

<section>
  
  <p>One of the more interesting enumerable methods I came across this week is Enumerable#inject. It's useful for a number of things, one of which is numerical operations, such as addition.</p>
  <p>Enumerable#inject takes an optional argument, and a block. The block executes once for each element within the object recieving Enumerable#inject.</p>
  <p>If .inject has an argument, such as:</p> 
  <blockquote>[2,4,6,8].inject(0){|result, element| result + element}</blockquote>
  <p>the argument 0 is the first element passed to the block. Then, the items within the object are passed to the block in the order they're listed. When inject's argument is passed to the block, it is represented by 'result.' When 2 from the array is passed in, it's represented by 'element'. With two elements within the block, the code to sum 'result' and 'element' is executed.</p>
  <p>After the first operation, 2 (from 0 + 2) becomes the 'result,' and is added with 4, the new 'element.' This will continue until the end of the array, when the of 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 is returned.</p>
  
  <p>Enumerable#inject can also be used to convert a 2D array into a hash, where the first item in each subarray becomes a hash key, and the second item becomes a hash value</p>
  <blockquote>hash = [["first_name", "Ted"], ["last_name, "Bogin"]].inject({}) do |result, element|
  result[element.first] = element.last
  result</blockquote>
  <blockquote>end</blockquote>
  <blockquote>hash # => {"first_name"=>"Ted", "last_name"=>"Bogin"}</blockquote>
  <p>Here, an empty hash is used as the argument for Enumerable#inject.</p>
  
  <p>With Enumerable#inject, it's also possible to build a new array using elements filtered from another array.</p>
  <blockquote>array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].inject([]) do |result, element|
  result.push(element.to_s) if element % 2 == 0</blockquote>
  <blockquote>result</blockquote>
  <blockquote>end</blockquote>
  <blockquote>array # => ["2", "4", "6"]</blockquote>
  <p>In this example, even-numbered elements from an array were converted to strings, and pushed into a new array using Enumerable#inject.</p>
