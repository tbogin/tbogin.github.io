<h1>Dev Bootcamp Week 6</h1>
<h2>class Gus</h2>
<h4>March 19th, 2016</h4>

<section>
  
  <p>This week, it’s been hammered home that a class in Ruby is a blueprint. Classes, from which new Ruby objects can be created, contain methods available to the descendant objects. In other words, a class passes on its internal behaviors, and its state of being, to new objects.</p>
  <p>Let’s build a class for something in the real world. My roommate’s bulldog seems like a good subject. Gus is pretty simple, with only a few behaviors constituting his state of being.</p>  
  
  <blockquote>class Gus</blockquote>
  <blockquote>end</blockquote>
  
  <p>The code above is all that’s needed to make a class. Though it doesn’t yet have any methods. The first method a class should have is its ‘initialize method,’ which contains the default parameters of any objects called from the class.</p>
  
  <blockquote>class Gus</blockquote>
  <blockquote>def initialize(sleep, eat)</blockquote>
	<blockquote>@sleep = sleep</blockquote>
  <blockquote>@eat = eat</blockquote>
  <blockquote>end</blockquote>
  <blockquote>end</blockquote>
  
  <p>The variables within the initialize method are called instance variables. Instance variables, defined by the @ symbol, are available to use throughout class methods. That means they’re not local to any single class.</p>
  <p>Now, Gus the bulldog needs methods that will make use of his propensity to sleep and eat.</p>
  
  <blockquote>class Gus</blockquote>
  <blockquote>def initialize(eat)</blockquote>
	<blockquote>@sleep = true</blockquote>
  <blockquote>@eat = eat</blockquote>
  <blockquote>end</blockquote>
  <blockquote>def nap</blockquote>
  <blockquote>puts "Gus is fast asleep."</blockquote>
  <blockquote>end</blockquote>
  <blockquote>def food</blockquote>
  <blockquote>@sleep = false</blockquote>
  <blockquote>puts "Gus knocks you over to reach his food bowl, filled to the brim with #{@food}."</blockquote>
  <blockquote>end</blockquote>
  <blockquote>end</blockquote>
  
  <p>In the initialize method, the instance variable for sleep is defaulted as true. The parameter for def initialize is the food Gus will eat when he finally wakes up. When a new instance of Gus is instantiated, it will require an argument of food.</p>
  <blockquote>dog = Gus.new("hard boiled egg")</blockquote>
  <p>Now we have a new version of Gus, created from the Gus blueprint, who is keen on getting his egg fix.</p>
