    <h1>Dev Bootcamp Week 1</h1>
    <h2>The Command Line and Version Control</h2>

        The first week of Dev Bootcamp is wrapping up.  After a couple days wondering what I’d gotten myself into, I finally feel comfortable performing the most basic of coding tasks: navigating the command line, and working with version control.

      <p>
        I’m the kind of person who often forgets where they parked.  I had also never used the command line, or code repositories, until four days ago.  Navigating my computer with such an efficient system was counterintuitive to me at first.  Adding and committing changes to my code upon git branches seemed like waving a wand.  But after sweating through some basic errors, and getting lost a few times, I can hopefully explain in basic terms what I’ve learned this week.

        The command line intimidated me the first few times I used it.  In a previous life, before Monday, I found and created files and folders through the time-consuming process of clicking and double clicking.  In contrast, the command line was fast and loose.  Small errors I made with cp and mv sent files where I didn’t want them.  I didn’t realize that ../ applied to more than cd.  Piping looked like hieroglyphics.  After too many hours, I finally feel a modicum of control over the command line.  It’s just a new way of interacting with a computer, a machine I’ve spent much of my life on.

        Week 1 of DBC also introduced me to version control, mainly via GitHub repositories.  To the uninitiated, version control is the ability to view the history of revisions made to a file, and to merge those changes with those of your collaborators.  With version control, you can create separate versions, of branches, of the same file in order to write new code without affecting the original file, until all changes have been agreed upon.  It’s useful for keeping your files as they are, until you’re ready to change them. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Git software, built into your computer, equips files with version control.  It operates by allowing you and your team to create, clone, modify, and merge files deriving from an original repository of code.  You can make any folder into a git repository using the handy ‘git init’ command.  Or you can clone files from a git repository on the cloud for your own use.  
        </p>
        <p>In Dev Bootcamp, I’ve been cloning remote repositories from GitHub.  Through a workflow of git commands, I’ve cloned repositories for local use, and ‘pushed’ assignments to their remote counterparts on GitHub.  GitHub is useful for storing repositories, as your code can be kept on the cloud.  When any number of things could happen to your own computer, GitHub provides a great backup for your projects.</p>
        <p>See you next time for DBC week 2.</p>
