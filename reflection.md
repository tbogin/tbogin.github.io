**What did you learn about CSS, padding, margin, and borders by doing this challenge?**

I learned that simple formatting is best, and that using % is a better practice than px for website responsiveness.

**What did you learn about CSS positioning?**

I learned that all elements have a default static position. I haven't yet decided whether I'll use relative, fixed, or absolute positioning for any of my elements yet.

**What aspects of your design did you find the easiest to implement? The most difficult?**

So far, I've kept my CSS to text-align, inline, and some image resizing. I'll add more CSS as the week/phase-0 continue, such as padding my profile picture. The most difficult part so far has been deciding which of the vast array of CSS attributes to use.

**In this challenge, what did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS?**

I learned there are dozens of CSS attributes I can use to format my HTML elements. I learned how to format text and images in a way that loads well on different browsers.
