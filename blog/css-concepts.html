<h1>Dev Bootcamp Week 3</h1>
<h2>Margins, Borders, and Padding</h2>
<h4>February 23, 2016</h4>

<p>Every webpage contains HTML elements, and every HTML element is surrounded by an invisible box. These boxes contain the content you see, such as images and words, surrounded by attributes such as padding, borders, and margins. These attributes, which can be modified using CSS, can be tricky to tell apart.</p>
<br>
<strong>Margins</strong>
<br>
<p>Margins refer to the empty space around an element. Larger margins mean more space between an element on the page and neighboring elements. </p>
<br>
<strong>Borders</strong>
<br>
<p>Borders are the edges of an element. Borders can be made visible with the 'border' CSS property.</p>
<br>
<strong>Padding</strong>
<br>
<p>Padding is the area of space between an element's content (text, picture, video), and its border. With CSS, padding can be adjusted relative to its border.</p>
